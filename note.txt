Choose SQL Databases When:
->Your data has a well-defined structure with clear relationships.
->Your application requires complex querying and reporting capabilities.
->You need strong consistency and ACID transactions.
->Vertical scalability is sufficient for your workload.

Choose NoSQL Databases When:
->Your data is semi-structured or unstructured.
->Your application requires horizontal scalability and high availability.
->Schema flexibility is important, and the schema may evolve over time.
->Your workload involves handling large volumes of data or high traffic loads.
->You're building modern, cloud-native applications or microservices architectures.


 An ODM (Object-Document Mapper) is a software library or framework used in conjunction
 with NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB.
It provides an abstraction layer that allows developers to interact with the database using
object-oriented programming constructs.
